Log, view, and export page visits. Useful for debugging, performance monitoring, security analysis, user behavior insights, and click fraud detection.

== Description ==

Traffic Monitor is a lightweight WordPress plugin that logs every page visit in real-time. Easily track IP addresses, user-agents, referrers, and moreâ€”directly from your admin panel. Perfect for debugging, performance monitoring, security analysis, user behavior insights, and click fraud detection.

== Key Features ==

* **Logs page requests** with details including IP address, referrer URL, browser, and more.
* **Displays structured request data** in an admin table with sortable columns.
* **Expandable request details**â€”view additional HTTP request fields per entry.
* **Bulk actions for selected records** â€“ Use the dropdown to delete or export specific logs.
* **One-click actions for all records** â€“ Quickly delete or export the entire log with dedicated buttons.

== Use Cases ==

* **Debugging:** Identify broken links, incorrect headers, or unexpected request behaviors.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Analyze frequently accessed pages and optimize site speed accordingly.
* **Security Analysis:** Detect unusual traffic patterns, excessive bot activity, or malicious attacks (DDoS, brute force, etc.).
* **User Behavior Insights:** See where your visitors come from and what devices, operating systems, and browsers they use.
* **Click Fraud Detection:** Spot multiple rapid clicks from the same IP address and user-agent combination.

ðŸš€ Track your visitors, detect threats, and optimize performanceâ€”all in one simple dashboard.

4. Activate the plugin from 'Plugins' page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long are logs stored? =
Traffic Monitor retains logs until manually deleted. If your site receives high traffic, regularly clearing logs will prevent excessive database growth.

= Does this plugin work with caching plugins or CDNs? =
Yes and no.

* If your CDN or caching plugin only caches static assets (images, fonts, scripts), Traffic Monitor will still log page requests.
* However, full-page caching (e.g., from WP Rocket, Cloudflare, or LiteSpeed Cache) bypasses WordPress, meaning Traffic Monitor wonâ€™t log those visits.

ðŸš€ **Pro Version Coming Soon**
If caching is detected on your home page, Traffic Monitor displays a notice in the plugin settings. This notice includes an email signup form to get notified when Traffic Monitor Pro is releasedâ€”allowing full tracking, even on cached pages.

= Does this plugin track visitors across pages? =
No, Traffic Monitor only logs individual HTTP requests, not full user sessions.

= Where is the request data stored? =
All logs are stored in a custom database table within your WordPress database.

= Can I export request logs? =
Yes, logs can be exported as a CSV file from the admin panel.

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =
No, Traffic Monitor is optimized to exclude unnecessary requests (e.g., static assets) and logs only essential data.
