No, Traffic Monitor only logs individual HTTP requests, not full user sessions.

= Where is the request data stored? =
All logs are stored in a custom database table within your WordPress database.

Yes, logs can be exported as a CSV file from the admin panel.

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =
