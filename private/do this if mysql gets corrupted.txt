WHAT TO DO IF MYSQL GETS CORRUPTED

TRY THIS FIRST*
If C:\xampp\mysql\backup\backup.sql file exists
1.	Open XAMPP Control Panel and stop everything
2.	Replace mysql folder at C:\xampp\mysql\
		Option 1: Copy C:\mysql.zip (previously saved) and extract it to C:\xampp\mysql\.
		Option 2: Download a fresh XAMPP ZIP and copy the mysql folder from it.
3.	Open XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache & MySQL.
4.  Open phpMyAdmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).
5.  Click on "New" → Create a database named wordpress_db.
6.  Click the "Import" tab.
7.  Select C:\xampp\mysql\backup\backup.sql and import.
8.	Login at http://localhost/wordpress/wp-login.php
9.  Verify all my plugins themes, pages, posts, media, and settings are still there


OTHERWISE DO THIS
Important: this method will:
✅ Keep your plugins, themes, and uploads (because wp-content/ is not touched).
❌ Erase all pages, posts, users, media library, and settings (because database is reset).

1.	Open XAMPP Control Panel and stop everything
2.	Backup C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\plugins (optional, just in case)
3.	Replace mysql folder at C:\xampp\mysql\
		Option 1: Copy C:\mysql.zip (previously saved) and extract it to C:\xampp\mysql\.
		Option 2: Download a fresh XAMPP ZIP and copy the mysql folder from it.
4.	Open XAMPP Control Panel and start Apache & MySQL.
5.	Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
6.	Create a new database named wordpress_db
7.  Go to http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php
8.  Complete install with login and email:

		dmitriamartin@gmail.com
9.	Go to http://localhost/wordpress/wp-login.php
10. Login and verify all my plugins are still there


* Prevent Data Loss by Automating Backups
Since MySQL corruption wipes the database, set up automatic backups:

1.	Open Notepad and paste: mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > C:\xampp\mysql\backup\backup.sql
2.  Save it as backup.bat in C:\xampp\mysql\backup\.
3.	Open Task Scheduler, create a new task:
		Trigger: Daily at 2 AM
		Action: Run backup.bat
4.	Now, even if MySQL crashes, you can restore your database in seconds.
