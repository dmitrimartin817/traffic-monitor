I want you to understand my plugin code and file structure.  The plugin is free with basic features.   I your help normalizing the database and getting the plugin to log cached pages.  The normalized database will include these tables:

NOTE: I'll use dbDelta() to create the table if it doesn't exist and update it if fields are added. dbDelta() requires very strict SQL formatting and does not accept FOREIGN KEYS! Avoid NOT NULL when possible for backward compatibility with existing logs.

tfcm_ip_addresses
	id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
	ip_address VARCHAR(45) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	country VARCHAR(2), -- will require an API call (future feature)
	asn VARCHAR(20), -- will require an API call (future feature)
	first_seen TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    last_seen TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    times_seen BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (id),
	KEY ip_address (ip_address)

tfcm_user_agents
	id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
	user_agent VARCHAR(512) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	device VARCHAR(50), -- PHP User Agent Parser, may be null if not present?
	operating_system VARCHAR(255), -- PHP User Agent Parser, may be null if not present?

	first_seen TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    last_seen TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    times_seen BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (id),
	KEY user_agent (user_agent)

tfcm_fingerprints
	id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
	ip_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    user_agent_id INT UNSIGNED, -- not every rquest may have a user agent
	fingerprint_hash BINARY(32) UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- SHA-256 hash of (IP + User-Agent)
	first_seen TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    last_seen TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    times_seen BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (id),
	KEY ip_id (ip_id),
    KEY user_agent_id (user_agent_id),
    KEY fingerprint_hash (fingerprint_hash)

tfcm_requested_pages - Stores requested page URLs without query strings for better analysis.
	id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
	page_url VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- request_url relative path only, no domain or query string
	first_requested TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    last_requested TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    times_requested BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (id),
	KEY page_url (page_url)
	
tfcm_referrer_pages - Stores only the base URL of referrers (without query strings).
	id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
	domain VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- referer_url without path or query string
	path VARCHAR(255), -- referer_url without domain or query string
	first_requested TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    last_requested TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    times_requested BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (id),
	KEY referrer_url (referrer_url)
	
tfcm_request_log - Stores references to the above tables and logs request-specific data.
	id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
	request_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
	page_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, -- from tfcm_requested_pages table
	page_query VARCHAR(255), -- query string of page requested
	disallowed TINYINT(1), -- if tfcm_requested_pages(page_url) is disallowed in robots.txt  (future feature?)
	load_time INT UNSIGNED, -- for dashboard. via AJAX? (future feature?)
	method VARCHAR(10),
	referer_id INT UNSIGNED, -- from tfcm_referrer_pages table, not every rquest may have a referer
	referer_query VARCHAR(255), -- query string of referer_url
	user_role VARCHAR(50),
	fingerprint_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, -- from tfcm_fingerprints table
	session_id_hash BINARY(32), -- for clickfraud detection, hashed for security
	viewport_height SMALLINT UNSIGNED,  -- via AJAX?
	viewport_width SMALLINT UNSIGNED,  -- via AJAX?
	host VARCHAR(255),
	origin VARCHAR(255),
	accept VARCHAR(255),
	accept_encoding VARCHAR(255),
	accept_language VARCHAR(255),
	content_type VARCHAR(255),
	connection_type VARCHAR(50),
	cache_control VARCHAR(255),
	status_code SMALLINT,
	PRIMARY KEY (id),
	KEY fingerprint_id (fingerprint_id),
    KEY page_id (page_id),
    KEY referer_id (referer_id),
    KEY request_time (request_time)

After making those changes, I'll begin marketing the plugin and developing a system to charge users.  At that point, the plugin will be available as a free trial that will log 5,000 page requests before users will need to pay to continue using it.  At that point they will be charged based upon how many requests per month the plugin logs and which tier that number falls within.  The base price per month will start very low but increases as more features are added. For example, pricing will start something like this: 

Tier Cost and Max Page Requests
$1	1,000
$2	4,000
$4	13,000
$8	40,000
$16	121,000
$32	364,000
$64	1,093,000

I have a roadmap of additional features planned for Traffic Monitor that do not include advance features like bot blocking and click fraud protection or .  Once the planned features are implemented, I'll decide whether to include these advanced features or fork the project to create a click fraud plugin and a bot blocking plugin (in that order).  I don't intend on ever competing with security and analytics plugins.

I find proceedural code and relational databases easier to understand and maintain.  All coding must follow current WordPress standards.  I am open to modifications to conform with OOP, Namespaces, Traits, Design Patterns, and SOLID principles ONLY if there are the solve problems that must be addressed.  

I'll share each required file in turn.  Proactively consider all shared files and their interconnections as part of the broader plugin architecture, avoiding piecemeal assumptions, redundant suggestions, and conflicting recommendations. Every directory has a blank index.php file for security.  Don't report on your analysis or start suggesting changes until I'm done sharing all files!  Here is the main file:
